  /**
   * Adjusts the zenith of astronomical sunrise and sunset to account for solar refraction, solar radius and
   * elevation. The value for Sun's zenith and true rise/set Zenith (used in this class and subclasses) is the angle
   * that the center of the Sun makes to a line perpendicular to the Earth's surface. If the Sun were a point and the
   * Earth were without an atmosphere, true sunset and sunrise would correspond to a 90&deg; zenith. Because the Sun
   * is not a point, and because the atmosphere refracts light, this 90&deg; zenith does not, in fact, correspond to
   * true sunset or sunrise, instead the centre of the Sun's disk must lie just below the horizon for the upper edge
   * to be obscured. This means that a zenith of just above 90&deg; must be used. The Sun subtends an angle of 16
   * minutes of arc (this can be changed via the {@link #setSolarRadius(double)} method , and atmospheric refraction
   * accounts for 34 minutes or so (this can be changed via the {@link #setRefraction(double)} method), giving a total
   * of 50 arcminutes. The total value for ZENITH is 90+(5/6) or 90.8333333&deg; for true sunrise/sunset. Since a
   * person at an elevation can see blow the horizon of a person at sea level, this will also adjust the zenith to
   * account for elevation if available. Note that this will only adjust the value if the zenith is exactly 90 degrees.
   * For values below and above this no correction is done. As an example, astronomical twilight is when the sun is
   * 18&deg; below the horizon or {@link AstronomicalCalendar#ASTRONOMICAL_ZENITH 108&deg;
   * below the zenith}. This is traditionally calculated with none of the above mentioned adjustments. The same goes
